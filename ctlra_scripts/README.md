Ctlra Scripts
=============

The scripts contained within this demo work with the
TCC scripting example app. It requires that you have
the TCC libraries installed on your system.

```
sudo apt-get install libtcc-dev
```

TCC version 0.9.26 has been used for testing - it is assumed later versions
should be OK assuming the API didn't change. Please contact OpenAV if there
are issues with installing / using Ctlra and TCC.
